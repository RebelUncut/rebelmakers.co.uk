			<em>* we're doing everything we can to make Rebel Makers a sustainable and scalable enterprise, so that everyone involved can have adequate support, and come to have autonomy over something they are proud to grow. One of the ways we are hoping to achieve this is through applying for funding. If successful, this funding will allow us to help you in more structured ways, for example weâ€™d love to help every Rebel Makers Club start a Hardware Hub by providing essential kit. This is something we'll be completely transparent about, and we will keep you updated every step of the way.</em>
