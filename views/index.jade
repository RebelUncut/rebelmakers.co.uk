                # We are the new Rebellion.

                Rebel Makers is a network of peer-to-peer making clubs for everyone who is interested in programming, electronics, and digital production - regardless of age or ability.  At our Clubs, Rebels get together to share existing knowledge and learn new skills in a fun, safe and collaborative environment, exploring anything and everything from development to digital production to service design. 

                The main aim of Rebel Makers is to break down barriers with technology, bringing lots of different people together, ultimately helping them to achieve and improve in whatever way they want to - whether that is sharing skills, meeting new people, improving prospects, or playing with some kick-ass fun stuff every month.

                You're free to bring a project to work on, ideas of specific skills you'd like to share or learn, or simply come along and see what you fun looks like! 

                ## Who is Rebel Makers for?

                Everyone! And we really do mean that. Rebel Makers is for people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds. So far, we've brought together people aged 5 to 72, those who simply think tech is kinda cool to those with pretty serious skills, and everyone in between. 
                
                ## What makes a Rebel?
                
                A Rebel is the name we give to every person attending Rebel Makers. We don't make distinctions based on age, ability or traditional roles such as mentor or participant. We do this to ensure our Clubs are democratic, collaborative spaces. 
                
                Every Club has at least one Rebel who assumes the role of Rebel Leader. The Rebel Leader is the main point of contact, and the person responsible for the organising and safe running of that Club.
