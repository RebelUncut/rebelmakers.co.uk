                # We are a set of peer-to-peer making clubs for everyone.

                Rebel Makers Clubs are monthly meetups for everyone who is interested in programming, electronics, and digital production - regardless of age or ability.  At our clubs, Rebels get together to share existing knowledge and learn new skills in a fun, safe and collaborative environment, exploring anything and everything from development to digital production to service design. 

                The main aim of Rebel Makers is to break down barriers with technology, bringing lots of different people together, ultimately helping them to achieve and improve in whatever way they want to - be it share skills, meet new people, improve prospects, or even just come play with some fun stuff every month.

                You're free to bring a project to work on, ideas of specific skills you'd like to share or learn, or simply come along and see what you fancy working on. 


                ## Who is Rebel Makers for?

                Everyone. And we really do mean that. Rebel Makers is for people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds.

                So far, we've brought together people aged 5 to 72, those who simply think tech is kinda cool to those with pretty serious skills, and everyone in between. We actively encourage you all to become Rebels.
